              Ground Control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your
              helmet on. Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven,
              six). Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three). Check
              ignition and may God's love be with you (two, one, liftoff). This
              is Ground Control to Major Tom.

              You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose
              shirts you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare.
              This is Major Tom to Ground Control. I'm stepping through the
              door.
